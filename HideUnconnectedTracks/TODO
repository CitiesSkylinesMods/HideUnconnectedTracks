- try to see if I can increase coverage by reusing materials/meshes instead of/in addition to netInfos. (done not tested)

bug: why some of the node infos from ronyx double tracks are not connected?

- support for tracks that have multiple wire/track nodeInfos.

- forbidden flag: level crossing.

- if info.connectGroup == DOUBLE and info.connectGroup == (None or DOUBLE):
     NetInfo.Node.connectGroup == None is same as NetInfo.Node.connectGroup == DOUBLE
