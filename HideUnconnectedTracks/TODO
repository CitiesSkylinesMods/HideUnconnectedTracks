bug: hide unconnected tracks can confuse left and right.
  1- undo the md5 changes to see if that fixes the problem
  2- load the saved game to see if the problem is fixed

- try to see if I can increase coverage by reusing materials/meshes instead of/in addition to netInfos.

- support for tracks that have multiple wire/track nodeInfos.
